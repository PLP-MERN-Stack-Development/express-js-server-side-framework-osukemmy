🚂 Week 2: Express.js – Server-Side Framework
🚀 Objective

Build a RESTful API using Express.js that implements standard CRUD operations, proper routing, middleware implementation, and error handling.

📂 Tasks
Task 1: Express.js Setup
Initialize a new Node.js project
Install Express.js and required dependencies
Create a basic Express server that listens on port 3000
Implement a "Hello World" route at the root endpoint
Task 2: RESTful API Routes
Create a resource called products with the following fields:
id (unique identifier)
name (string)
description (string)
price (number)
category (string)
inStock (boolean)
Implement the following RESTful routes:
GET /api/products: List all products
GET /api/products/:id: Get a specific product by ID
POST /api/products: Create a new product
PUT /api/products/:id: Update an existing product
DELETE /api/products/:id: Delete a product
Task 3: Middleware Implementation
Create a custom logger middleware that logs the request method, URL, and timestamp
Implement a middleware to parse JSON request bodies
Create an authentication middleware that checks for an API key in the request headers
Add validation middleware for the product creation and update routes
Task 4: Error Handling
Implement global error handling middleware
Create custom error classes for different types of errors (e.g., NotFoundError, ValidationError)
Add proper error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes
Handle asynchronous errors using try/catch blocks or a wrapper function
Task 5: Advanced Features
Implement query parameters for filtering products by category
Add pagination support for the product listing endpoint
Create a search endpoint that allows searching products by name
Implement route for getting product statistics (e.g., count by category)
🧪 Expected Outcome
A fully functional Express.js API with proper RESTful routes
Well-structured middleware for logging, authentication, and validation
Comprehensive error handling with appropriate status codes and messages
Advanced features like filtering, pagination, and search
🛠️ Setup
Make sure you have Node.js installed (v18 or higher recommended)
Use the provided server.js file as a starting point
Install the required dependencies:
npm install express body-parser uuid


For testing your API, you can use tools like Postman, Insomnia, or curl
✅ Submission Instructions
Accept the GitHub Classroom assignment invitation
Clone your personal repository that was created by GitHub Classroom
Add the following files to your repository:
All your project files (server.js, routes, middleware, etc.)
A README.md file with:
Instructions on how to run your server
Documentation of your API endpoints
Examples of requests and responses
A .env.example file showing required environment variables
Commit and push your changes to GitHub
Your submission will be automatically graded based on the criteria in the autograding configuration
The instructor will review your submission after the autograding is complete
